1. PUBLIC - Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
	 -- If a software engineer were to lie about the abilities of a software
	 that is meant to proctor exams online to view content on the computer, 
	 they would be breaking this principle.
	 
2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER - Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest. 
	-- If a software engineer were to lie to their employer about their ability 
	to create a software to record transaction patterns and instead used 
	software from another company without clearance, they would break this 
	principle.
	
3. PRODUCT - Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
	-- If a software engineer created a paid software to allow people to control
	smart appliances in their houses that did not function properly because
	of a lack of testing, and did not provide useful maintenance for the problems,
	they would be breaking this principle.
	
5. MANAGEMENT - Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.
	-- If a manager of software engineers was to not allow a software engineer to
	work on part of a project the person is qualified for, due to a personal
	grudge or personal feelings about the person, they would be breaking this
	principle.
	
7. COLLEAGUES - Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.
	-- If a software engineer were to collaborate on a project or make use of some
	work done by someone else, and give due credit to the person while using 
	their work with permission, they are following this principle.
